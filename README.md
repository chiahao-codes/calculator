## Description

>  This is a standard calculator application based in the browser. It performs simple arithmetic for the user.


## Reason For Making

This was my very first portfolio project. At the time, I did not know what would make a good portfolio project.
I looked to articles and videos posted online by established web developers. After seeing a calculator being mentioned several times as a worthy idea, I decided to build it. The link to the tutorial I used is listed below!
